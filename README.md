This web page contains information about a software engineering effort to port the [Madgraph5_aMC@NLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) Monte Carlo event generator onto GPUs. The main development goals are

- Execution of physics event processes on GPU architectures
- Optimisation of the existing CPU implementation, cross-fertilized from the GPU developments 
- Heterogeneous execution on CPU and GPU architectures
- Implementations in various GPU programming languages and hardware abstraction layers
- Merge developments into the upstream Madgraph5_aMC@NLO code generator 

The development team of this effort comprises students, faculty and researchers at various institutes and universities (see also [Development Team](https://github.com/orgs/madgraph5/people))

- Argonne National Lab (US)
- CERN (CH)
- PES University (IN)
- University Catholique de Louvain (BE)
- University of Sussex (UK)
